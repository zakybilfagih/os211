# Top 10 List of Week 03

## 1. [The Btrfs filesystem: An introduction](https://lwn.net/Articles/576276/)
This article talks about the Btrfs, the expected next-generation filesystem for Linux. It has support for making snapshots with smart linking duplicate files, and also 'self-healing' support with checksums for both data and metadata which can automatically detect silent data corruptions.  This article is interesting since it talks about how Btrfs is different from other filesystems and how the development is going with Btrfs. One of the distribution that support Btrfs out of the box is openSUSE which you could try right now!

## 2. [Nix, a fully functional package manager that makes reproducible and reliable systems ](https://nixos.org/guides/how-nix-works.html)
Nix is a very interesting package manager which take functional ideas to a package manager. This means that there is a configuration which declares all the packages on your machine. Nix works on darwin (osx), and linux, with a plethora of distro that supports it. This article shows how Nix package manager works under the hood, which created symlinks on the usual unix file directories, definitely worth the read :)

## 3. [Fossil, an Archival File Server](http://doc.cat-v.org/plan_9/4th_edition/papers/fossil/)
Fossil is an interesting file system developed for the Plan 9 operating system. Fossil differs from other file system due to its support for snapshots/archival features. What is interesting is that the snapshots feature is does not need root privilages since unlike ext4 or most linux file systems, fossil enforce file permissions, thus a user cannot see or snoop on another's old files. This article linked goes deep on how the fossil file system is implemented.

## 4. [Writing a Linux File System for Fun](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLR17lUjTpc&t=1s)
The UNIX Filesystem story goes back to the first implementation of the operating system. Since then there were many different implementations and improvements, that makes filesystems quite complicated but also rock solid piece of software. Currently, most people treat FS as a black box or indivisible part of OS. 
In this video the speaker present us some basics about file systems by doing a simple implementation of a filesystem!

## 5. [The UNIX Time-Sharing System](https://chsasank.github.io/classic_papers/unix-time-sharing-system.html)
This is the original paper of the UNIX Time-Sharing System which is written by Dennis M. Ritchie and Ken Thompson. The interesting part is that the design choices on this paper significantly influenced modern OS design until now (Linux, BSD, Darwin, ..). The paper is a breeze to read and flows like a tutorial, starting from the history and how the system of that era effected the choices made in this paper.

## 6. [Benefits of Logical Volume Management on a Small System](https://tldp.org/HOWTO/LVM-HOWTO/benefitsoflvmsmall.html)
This TLDP how-to article shows why a LVM is a good idea for a small system. In a linux system deciding to make a partition can sometime be a dillema because we don't know which partition is going to get the largest over time, this article shows how LVM can handle that issue.

## 7. [A Minimum Complete Tutorial of Linux ext4 File System](https://metebalci.com/blog/a-minimum-complete-tutorial-of-linux-ext4-file-system/)
This article describe Linux ext4 file system as simple and as comprehensive as possible with examples. This article sytled tutorial is great since it explains how to use a fully functional ext4 filesystem with it's intricacy.

## 8. [Every get confused with Windows FAT's ??](https://www.tech-recipes.com/rx/2801/exfat_versus_fat32_versus_ntfs/)
Sometimes I get confused with Windows FAT's filesystem. This article shows the difference between them and show the issue between all of them and reccomend what file system to use for your system.

## 9. [Files & File Systems: Crash Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KN8YgJnShPM)
This computer science crash course video talks about how we store data on a storage medium and how it is represented. The video gives us a brief understading of the topic and tops it off with alot of great illustrations.

## 10. [Where Do Deleted Files Go?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5s4-Kak49o)
This interesting video by vsauce talks about alot of interesting things (as expected xD) from the question in the title to a video about existential crisis. And as always, thanks for watching.
