# Top 10 List of Week 04

## 1. [How linking works](https://joellaity.com/2020/01/25/linking.html)
This article explains how the linking process works in the C++ language (also used in alot of statically typed language like C, Rust, ect). The article introduce how the process of compilation works under the hood with easy to follow examples and clear illustrations. A must read since its quite concise and easy to read.

## 2. [Writing an OS in Rust: Introduction to Paging](https://os.phil-opp.com/paging-introduction/)
This article introduces paging, a very common memory management scheme which is used by the series author for the build-from-scratch OS project . The article explains why memory isolation is needed, how segmentation works, what virtual memory is, and how paging solves memory fragmentation issues. It also explores the layout of multilevel page tables on the x86-64 architecture. The code examples uses Rust which I am not familiar with, but the concepts are clearly explained and is a good article to get the grasp of what paging really is and how it is implemented in an OS.

## 3. [What a C programmer should know about memory](https://marek.vavrusa.com/memory/)
The concept of virtual memory is still confusing to many, as if it was a kind of magic. This article tries to convey the practical side of things (i.e. what can you do) from the more theoritical, to more fun stuff. The examples are going to be C99 on Linux, but a lot of topics are universal and platform agnostic (for the Windows user out there :)).

## 4. [Triple Ref Pointer?!?!?!!?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZEX_l0DFK0)
Get scared by the title? or the word pointer? or the world triple pointer?! Fear not, this Computerhile video about pointers explained by Professor Brailsford uses LEGO to try explaining what a pointer really is and why you shouldn't be scared of pointers.

## 5. [Designing File Formats](https://www.fadden.com/tech/file-formats.html)
There are many, many file formats, largely because in reality there are many different kinds of files. They range from simple ASCII text documents to complex databases. This article try to show the few elements that should be part of any structured file and throws some examples for it.

## 6. [How to Think About Variables in C](https://denniskubes.com/2013/04/23/how-to-think-about-variables-in-c/)
C is memory with syntactic sugar and as such it is helpful to think of things in C as starting from memory. The writer of this article think that variables and data types are often overlooked. He suggest that if you have the right mental model for variables and data types it makes other concepts in C, and other langauages, easier. Definitely an interesting read!

## 7. [musl: leaner and meaner alternative to glibc](https://musl.libc.org/about.html)
musl is an implementation of the standard library functionality described in the ISO C and POSIX standards, plus common extensions, built on top of the Linux system calls API. musl is an alternative to glibc (GNU libc) which is have a bigger and older code base. musl is awesome for low powered device since its leaner and uses less resources overall.

## 8. [Linux Memory Management FAQ: Rob Landley](http://landley.net/writing/memory-faq.txt)
A concise FAQ on memory management topics starting from virtual memory, pages, shared library, and other related topic. Written by Rob Landley, creater of Toybox.

## 9. [Endianness Explained With an Egg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcaiHcBvDR4)
Yep you read it right, and egg. A must watch and will make you understand what endianness is really about.

## 10. [Go Back In Time: Hand Knitten Core Memory](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwsInQLmjXc)
Ferrite core memory was the dominant computer memory technology from the 1950s to the late 1970s. Apollo AGC computers uses this type memory until the earyly 70s. Look how far we have come!
