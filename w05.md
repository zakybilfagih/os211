# Top 10 List of Week 04

## 1. [What a C programmer should know about memory](https://marek.vavrusa.com/memory/)
The concept of virtual memory is still confusing to many, as if it was a kind of magic. This article tries to convey the practical side of things (i.e. what can you do) from the more theoritical, to more fun stuff. The examples are going to be C99 on Linux, but a lot of topics are universal and platform agnostic (for the Windows user out there :)).

## 2. [Exploring Windows virtual memory management](https://www.triplefault.io/2017/08/exploring-windows-virtual-memory.html)
The article goes in depth on how the Windows operating system translate virtual memory address into physical address and how it plays with the specified 64 bit paging structure specified by both Intel and AMD on their x64 extension. An interesting read with thorough example and easy to understand explanation.

## 3. [An introduction to virtual memory](https://www.internalpointers.com/post/introduction-virtual-memory)
An article that explain virtual memory from scratch, starting from the 'why' and then the 'how' although in a simplistic manner. A very good read for anyone who want to refresh their understanding of what a virtual memory really is.

## 4. [Linux Memory Management FAQ: Rob Landley](http://landley.net/writing/memory-faq.txt)
A concise FAQ on memory management topics starting from virtual memory, pages, shared library, and other related topic. Written by Rob Landley, creater of Toybox a busybox alternative.

## 5. [Writing an OS in Rust: Introduction to Paging](https://os.phil-opp.com/paging-introduction/)
This article introduces paging, a very common memory management scheme which is used by the series author for the build-from-scratch OS project . The article explains why memory isolation is needed, how segmentation works, what virtual memory is, and how paging solves memory fragmentation issues. It also explores the layout of multilevel page tables on the x86-64 architecture. The code examples uses Rust which I am not familiar with, but the concepts are clearly explained and is a good article to get the grasp of what paging really is and how it is implemented in an OS.

## 6. [Page Fault and Memory Swapping](https://scoutapm.com/blog/understanding-page-faults-and-memory-swap-in-outs-when-should-you-worry)
This article explains how can you tell as the programmer, that page fault is slowing your application down, and how to mitigate it. It also explain the detail on how page fault works and give us the reader clear examples and good illustrations to draw its point. Definitely a good read.

## 7. [Virtual Memory With 256 Bytes of RAM](https://blog.robertelder.org/virtual-memory-with-256-bytes-of-ram/)
The author of this article explains how he implemented a virtual memory on his 'one-page' CPU and throws an interactive demo for us to play with. A very interesting read on the process on how he implemented the feature from scratch.

## 8. [Anatomy of a Program in Memory](https://manybutfinite.com/post/anatomy-of-a-program-in-memory/)
Memory management is the heart of operating systems. It is crucial for both programming and system administration. This article will covers how program are laid out on memory. The article approach the question with an eye towards practical aspects, but without shying away from internals. A very good read on understanding the high level overview of virtual memory.

## 9. [Virtual Memory Through Paging](http://littleosbook.github.io/#virtual-memory-through-paging)
This little segment on the little os book explains how paging improve the usage of virtual memory, it explains the topic in a very concise manner. I think the whole book is a very good read on getting to know how OS works and gives the reader further information on more in depth resource.

## 10. [Writing an OS in Rust: Paging Implementation](https://os.phil-opp.com/paging-implementation/)
This article shows how to implement paging support in the kernel. It first explores different techniques to make the physical page table frames accessible to the kernel and discusses their respective advantages and drawbacks. After seeing the introduction to paging (see link #5) the author will guide us trough how to implement paging into the kernel. Although the code is written in Rust, I think we can still read along and get some knowledge on how paging is implemented.
