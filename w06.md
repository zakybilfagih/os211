# Top 10 List of Week 06

## 1. [Concurrency in C](https://www.classes.cs.uchicago.edu/archive/2018/spring/12300-1/lab6.html)
This lab article provided by the CS department at the University of Chichago brush upon writing concurrent program in C. The article first talk about using threads, how to use them, and give examples for each topic. After talking about threads, the article talks about the problems that come up when writing concurrent programs like race conditions, mutating shared memory, etc. After explaining the problem, the article shows how to mitigate them with synchronization patterns with mutex and atomicity, which we will learn on week seven.

## 2. [Concurrency: A Primer](https://sookocheff.com/post/concurrency/concurrency-a-primer/)
This article talks all about the basics of concurrency from the background on why you might wan't to write concurrent programs until how to actually write them with examples written in Java. The article is divided into three parts, first the background on what concurrency is, difference between threads and processes, and also the difference between concurrency and parallelism. The next sections talks about how to manage state using the SRC threads model (see #4 list to learn more), and how to write thread safe code. On the last part of the article, the author gives several concurrency patterns on how to effectively manage shared state (with examples, yay!).

## 3. [Back to Basics: Concurrency](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6Ipn7gCOsY)
This one hour CppCon video by Arthur O'Dwyer talks about writing concurrent program in C++, this talk explain how to use the built-in standard library package to write easy to comprehend concurrent program without losing the performance over using the error-prone primitive concurrent models. By using abstraction we can write more safe concurrent program without losing performance with the overhead of abstracted libraries.

## 4. [Andrew Birrell's An Introduction to Programming with Threads: Why Use Concurrency?](https://www.hpl.hp.com/techreports/Compaq-DEC/SRC-RR-35.pdf)
This paper provides an introduction to writing concurrent programs with “threads”. A threads facility allows you to write programs with multiple simultaneous points of execution, synchronizing through shared memory. The paper describes the basic thread and synchronization primitives, then for each primitive provides a tutorial on how to use it. The tutorial sections provide advice on the best ways to use the primitives, give warnings about what can go wrong and offer hints about how to avoid these pitfalls. The paper is aimed at experienced programmers who want to acquire practical expertise in writing concurrent programs.

## 5. [Concurrency is not Parallelism by Rob Pike](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oV9rvDllKEg&t=1614s)
In this talk, Rob Pike talks about what concurrency is and how is it different than parallelism. He concluded that concurrency can make parallelism (and scaling everything else) easy. Rob also talks about writing a concurrent program in Go with example of a load balancer.

## 6. [Bell Labs and CSP Threads](https://swtch.com/~rsc/thread/)
This page is a slice of the history of concurrent programming, focusing on one particular lineage of Hoare's language of communicating sequential processes (CSP). This article argued that the regular SRC thread model is too low-level and need to be used with other concepts to be a good pattern. This paper also talks about how Go decided to use the CSP for the Go language.

## 7. [Communicating Sequential Processes: A Different Perspective of Thinking About Concurrent Programming](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~crary/819-f09/Hoare78.pdf)
C. A. R. Hoare in his 1978 paper, suggests that input and output are basic primitives of programming and that parallel composition of communicating sequential processes is a fundamental program structuring method. When combined with a development of Dijkstra’s guarded command, these concepts become surprisingly versatile.

## 9. [Let's #TalkConcurrency with Sir Tony Hoare](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQTjuePyN7M&t=7s)
Computer scientist Sir Tony Hoare FRS FREng is well-known for developing the sorting algorithm Quicksort in 1959/1960, which is a systematic method for placing the elements of an array in order. He is also know as the pioneer of concurrent programming.

## 8. [Parallelism and concurrency need different tools](http://yosefk.com/blog/parallelism-and-concurrency-need-different-tools.html)
Parallelism and concurrency are both very fashionable notions. Lots of languages and tools are advertised as good at these things – often at both things. The writer believes believe that concurrency and parallelism call for very different tools, and each tool can be really good at either one or the other.

## 10. [Visualizing Concurrency in Go](https://divan.dev/posts/go_concurrency_visualize/)
One of the strongest sides of Go programming language is a built-in concurrency based on Tony Hoare’s CSP paper. Go is designed with concurrency in mind and allows us to build complex concurrent pipelines. But have you ever wondered - how various concurrency patterns look like? Well, this article is for you!
