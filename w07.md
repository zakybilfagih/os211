# Top 10 List of Week 07

## 1. [POSIX Thread Programming](https://hpc-tutorials.llnl.gov/posix/)
Before jumping to the land of synchronization, maybe it's a good idea to refresh ourselves with the idea of threads. This tutorial explain us the idea of threads using the POSIX thread library. After that, the article talks about the idea of synchronization using mutexes and condition variables. A good read to refresh our knowledge on concurrency with POSIX C.

## 2. [Concurrency: A Primer](https://sookocheff.com/post/concurrency/concurrency-a-primer/)
this article talks all about the basics of concurrency from the background on why you might wan't to write concurrent programs until how to actually write them with examples written in java. the article is divided into three parts, first the background on what concurrency is, difference between threads and processes, and also the difference between concurrency and parallelism. the next sections talks about how to manage state using the src threads model (see #4 list to learn more), and how to write thread safe code. on the last part of the article, the author gives several concurrency patterns on how to effectively manage shared state (with examples, yay!).

## 3. [Concurrent Programming: Handling Shared Memory](https://web.mit.edu/6.005/www/fa14/classes/17-concurrency/)
This MIT course on concurrency brush up on the idea of the paradigms of handling shared memory on a concurrent program. The article starts on defining the idea of concurrency and how both paradigms handle the problem of shared memory. This article also gives examples of the problem of shared memory and also talks about the problem of race condition, which is a problem that can come up on a concurrent program that tries to handle shared memory.

## 4. [Mini FAQ: Thread Safety and Synchronization In A Nutshell](https://herbsutter.com/2014/01/13/gotw-95-solution-thread-safety-and-synchronization/)
This article was written to answer a set of related frequently asked questions on concurrency, written by Herb Sutter a ISO C++ comitee member for over 10 years. This mini FAQ talks about “thread safety and synchronization in a nutshell,” and the points cover apply to thread safety and synchronization in pretty much any mainstream language.

## 5. [Concurrent programming, with examples](https://begriffs.com/posts/2020-03-23-concurrent-programming.html)
This article covers the production workhorses for concurrent software – threading and locking – and learn about them through a series of interesting programs. This article is meant to be an introduction rather than a reference, the writer intent for this article is to give the reader an overview understanding and hope by the end of this article the reader will know the terminology and patterns used by POSIX threads (pthreads). 

## 6. [Dekker's Algorithm, With Visuals!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqnpIwN7dz0)
This video talks about the problem of shared data, and how Dekker's algorithm solve this problem. This video explains the algorithm with great visuals and give the intuition on why the algorithm works.

## 7. [The 12 Commandments of Synchronization](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.227.3871&rep=rep1&type=pdf)
In the beginning, there was hardware. Now the hardware was formless and empty, darkness was over the surface of silicon. And then the creator said “let there be operating systems,” and there were OSes. The creator saw that OSes were good. And the creator said “let there be processes, and threads.” OSes were teeming with processes and threads carrying out different tasks. Then the creator said “let the processes and threads synchronize with each other.” For this task,the creator appointed human-kind. But humans were fallible, and weak, and they failed to getsynchronization correct, and fallen angel BSOD (pronounced beesod), spawn of Beelzebub, ruled the day with great evil. So the creator sent the following commandments. This paper talks about the commandments (or principles) to write safe concurrent program. And by abiding this principles (we, mere mortals) can be safe from the evil of buggy concurrent programs.

## 8. [Samy Al Bahra on Making Lockless Synchronization Fast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aV-RyMXXuks)
Multicore systems are ubiquitous but modern concurrent programming techniques still do not see wide-spread adoption. Most concurrent software (developed in low-level languages) still relies on error-prone and unscalable memory management techniques for correctness despite the introduction of superior methods over 31 years ago. Safe memory reclamation allows for performant and robust memory management that is also suitable for advanced concurrent programming techniques such as non-blocking synchronization. If properly used, safe memory reclamation techniques allow improved performance and simplicity without the complexity of full-blown garbage collection.

## 9. [E2E: Erik Meijer and Burton Smith - Concurrency, Parallelism and Programming](https://channel9.msdn.com/Shows/Going+Deep/E2E-Erik-Meijer-and-Burton-Smith-Concurrency-Parallelism-and-Programming)
The great Burton Smith, Microsoft Technical Fellow and an international leader in high-performance computer architecture and programming languages for parallel computing joins functional programming purist and language design guru Erik Meijer to discuss several major themes of parallel computing and distributed programming. As always, you will get a lesson in history, present trends and future possibilities. This is simply an awesome and deeply wonderful conversation.

## 10. [Concurrent Affairs: Procedural Programming Unlocked](https://paperswelove.org/2015/video/samy-al-bahra-lockless-synchronization/)
Many programmers assume that procedural programming is a term of insult, or is a paradigm relegated to the past. And when it comes to concurrency, the prevalence of threads running riot through mutable shared state can be at laid the doorstep of procedural thinking. But multithreading was not the procedural paradigm's only response to the question of concurrency. The speaker, Kelvin Henney, also talks about the shared state chart where how concurrency come in play with immutability and how we can strife for immutability and prevent shared state on our code to get ourselves out of the synchronization problem.
