# Top 10 List of Week 08

## 1. [Multi Programming - Computerphile](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MB0yDMQj1lU)
Multitasking is a hoax - clever techniques mean that your CPU is shuffling between lots of tasks, but doing them one at a time. Dr Steve Bagley regenerates his clones to explain... also with candy and handwritten graphs!

## 2. [Context Switching - Computerphile](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKmBRl8j3Ak)
How does an operating system juggle different programs? Dr Steve Bagley explains Context Switching with great illustration and examples. Previously we talked about multiprogramming and how a process may switch between processes. Now comes OS context swtich, rather than the program control when to switch process, we delegate may that task to the OS and let the OS switch the processes for us.

## 3. [Understanding Uniprocessor OS Scheduling Policies](https://spin.atomicobject.com/2015/02/26/uniprocessor-scheduling-policies/)
This article talks about different process scheduling policies that may be implemented in an operating system specifically short-term scheduling on a multiprogramming system. The article brush up on the terminology multiprogramming, and also the notion of three parts of scheduling. After that, the article explain five examples of scheduling policies algorithms. The article gives a good explanation on each algorithms and also provides charts so that the reader can understand the approach of the algorithm better. Although the article didn't talk about the comparison between each policies, it will be explained in another article written by the same author (it's on list #4)

## 4. [A Comparison of 5 Uniprocessor OS Scheduling Policies](https://spin.atomicobject.com/2015/04/27/uniprocessor-scheduling-policy-comparison/)
Previously, the article talks about five different scheduling policies, and now, this article compares each policies and analyze each use cases for each algorithm. The writer first talks about two different types of scheduling criteria and how each criteria may employ different approach to achieve its goals.

## 5. [Scheduling in NetBSD](https://manikishan.wordpress.com/2020/05/10/scheduling-in-netbsd-part-1/)
This article talks about the scheduling API in the NetBSD operating system. Firstly, the article give a brief explanation on what is a scheduler and it's algorithms. After that, the article explains about how NetBSD internals handle things like processes and threads. Then, the article jumps to the utilities that is provided by the OS that we the end user can use from the commaand line. The article gives an interesting insight on how other operating system implements scheduling, which by no suprise not so different from other operating system like Linux.

## 6. [About Processes and Threads](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/windows/win32/procthread/about-processes-and-threads)
This article from Microsoft website talks about the difference between a process and a thread in the Windows operating system. Although the article talks about a specific implementation, the idea is more or less the same between OS'es. This article also talks about the type of multitasking that Windows support which is preemptive multitasking which creates the effect of simultaneous execution of multiple threads from multiple processes.

## 7. [Real Time Operating Systems (RTOS) - Nate Graff](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSvv_ELkSMM)
This video gives a really great Introduction to real-time operating systems. The presenter firstly explains what a real-time operating system is, and why there are many confusions to it. And then, explains the use cases of a real-time operating systems, after that, jumps right to the implementation to a real world example of a real-time operating system called FreeRTOS and explain how the operating system schedule its process. A very good introduction to the topic and a fun presentation to watch.

## 8. [Introduction to Realtime Linux](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BKkX9WASfpI)
This presentation talks about the effort of the implementing real-time feature to the linux kernel. The speaker first define on what real-time really means and remove all misconceptions of what a real-time operating system means. The presenter also ditch the notion of 'soft' real-time and why it is a bad idea to talk about it and make sure that the real-time he meant is the 'hard' real-time, where we can determinately know the timing behaviour of our operating system.

## 9. [Real-time vs. General Purpose Operating System](https://www.microcontrollertips.com/real-time-standard-how-to-choose-rtos/)
This article gives a brief explanation on why you would want to use a real-time operating system rather than a regular general purpose operating system. If you think that you may need a real-time operating system based on your use case, this article also suggest what OS to consider, since on the real-time OS niche there is a lot of variety that you can choose from.

## 10. [Multitasking Operating Systems as Fast As Possible](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mINZ-YFO88c)
This rather fast video explains briefly how an operating system manages it processes. Altough explaining the topic in a simplistic manner the video gives relatable analogy and give some real world examples on how OS multitasking works.
