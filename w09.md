# Top 10 List of Week 09

## 1. [BIOS](https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/b/bios.htm)
Short for Basic Input/Output System, the BIOS (pronounced bye-oss) is a ROM chip found on motherboards that allows you to access and set up your computer system at the most basic level. The picture below is an example of what a BIOS chip may look like on a computer motherboard. The BIOS pictured is of an early AMIBIOS, a type of BIOS manufactured by AMI.

## 2. [Disk Structure](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9G7-K8VCzk&feature=youtu.be)
Video tentang struktur disk magnetik dan istilah platter, arm assembly, track, sector, CAV (Constant Angular Velocity) dan juga mngajarkan untuk melihat mengapa kepadatan bit dipertahankan lebih rendah di track luar daripada track dalam.

## 3. [What is systemd?](https://www.linode.com/docs/guides/what-is-systemd/)
systemd is a Linux initialization system and service manager that includes features like on-demand starting of daemons, mount and automount point maintenance, snapshot support, and processes tracking using Linux control groups. systemd provides a logging daemon and other tools and utilities to help with common system administration tasks.

## 4. [Bootloader: What you need to know about the system boot manager](https://www.ionos.com/digitalguide/server/configuration/what-is-a-bootloader/)
A bootloader, also known as a boot program or bootstrap loader, is a special operating system software that loads into the working memory of a computer after start-up. For this purpose, immediately after a device starts, a bootloader is generally launched by a bootable medium like a hard drive, a CD/DVD or a USB stick. The boot medium receives information from the computer’s firmware (e.g. BIOS) about where the bootloader is. The whole process is also described as “booting”.

## 5. [What is RAID?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aa0RTgxJJy8)
Redundant array of independent disks (RAID) is a storage technology that balances data protection, system performance, and storage space by determining how the storage system distributes data. Many different ways of distributing data have been standardized into various RAID levels. Each RAID level offers a trade-off of data protection, system performance, and storage space. For example, one RAID level might improve data protection but reduce storage space. Another RAID level might increase storage space but also reduce system performance.

## 6. [Program for SSTF disk scheduling algorithm](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/program-for-sstf-disk-scheduling-algorithm/)
Basic idea is the tracks which are closer to current disk head position should be serviced first in order to minimise the seek operations.

## 7. [What is NAS (Network Attached STorage?](https://www.seagate.com/id/id/tech-insights/what-is-nas-master-ti/)
Sistem NAS adalah perangkat penyimpanan yang tersambung ke jaringan dan memungkinkan penyimpanan maupun pengambilan data dari lokasi terpusat untuk pengguna jaringan dan klien heterogen yang sah.

## 8. [What Is UEFI, and How Is It Different from BIOS?](https://www.howtogeek.com/56958/htg-explains-how-uefi-will-replace-the-bios/)
Both UEFI and BIOS are low-level software that starts when you boot your PC before booting your operating system, but UEFI is a more modern solution, supporting larger hard drives, faster boot times, more security features, and—conveniently—graphics and mouse cursors.

## 9. [What Is a Storage Array? Data Server and Disk Architecture](https://www.dnsstuff.com/storage-array)
A storage array, also called a disk array, is a data storage system for block-based storage, file-based storage, or object storage. Rather than store data on a server, storage arrays use multiple drives in a collection capable of storing a huge amount of data, managed by a central management system.

## 10. [Boot Block in Operating System](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/boot-block-in-operating-system/)
Basically for a computer to start running to get an instance when it is powered up or rebooted it need to have an initial program to run. And this initial program which is known as bootstrap need to be simple. It must initialize all aspects of the system, from CPU registers to device controllers and the contents of the main memory and then starts the operating system.
