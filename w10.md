# 4 Tips For Next Semester OS Class

The OS course is quite fun and give a high level overview of the ins and outs of an operating system. This class is also a good opportunity to dive in into linux and unix utilities, as it is useful very useful in a lot of scenario. Here are some tips on how to get by this class and some mistakes i've made and how to do better!

## 1. Try Linux!
Trying other operating system may be intimidating but I think it's worth the hassle since it will give you alot of understanding on how things under the hood works. Playing around in the virtual machine is a good start and maybe try dual booting your previous operating system and then try linux full time.

## 2. Try not to procrastinate on the assignment.
Heheheh, the assignment is quite straight forward and procrastinanting will not help, If you do the assigment fast, you will have more time searching for more interesting top 10 links and also have plenty of time to check out other interesting stuff.

## 3. Prepare to do daily quiz xD
The first weekly quiz is dead simple but there is a deadline of about 30 minutes. Make sure that you do the quiz since it's quite a big chunk of the weekly grading score.

## 4. Do the LFS assignment ;-)
Doing the LFS assignment is quite fun, altough building all of the stuff from source may be cumbersome, the guide is quite straightforward and you can learn alot about how to create a system from scratch. Also if you finished the LFS path, try out the BLFS path to add more program like a window manager and more intersting stuff (and maybe try using Gentoo for a more practical daily driver system)
